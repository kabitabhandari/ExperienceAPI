     * Mock Web server allows our code to use real HTTP calls to a **local endpoint**. We get the benefit of testing
     * the intended HTTP interactions and dont have to face any challenge of mocking a complex Fluent Client, like
     * Reactive ones. Using Mock Web server is highly recommended to write the integration tests.
